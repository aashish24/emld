Dear CRAN,

I am pleased to submit the initial release of the emld package, a tool for transforming the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) in 
JavaScript Object Notation, Linked Data (JSON-LD) format and subsequently working with these metadata files as semantically
linked data, following the Resource Description Framework (RDF).  This helps mobilize the hundreds of thousands of 
EML metadata files that have been and continue to be generated by major ecological research efforts to interface with
RDF-based tools favored by information researchers and JSON-based tools favored by many developers.
